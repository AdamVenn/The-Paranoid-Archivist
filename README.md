# The-Paranoid-Archivist
A program to copy files to multiple locations written in Python.

The Paranoid Archivist uses wxPython and the Python standard library to provide a cross-platform GUI program to make and schedule multiple copies of a folder, filtering out unwanted subfolders, file types and old versions of videos. It was originally a little automation for a media company, to keep the server free of heavy file operations during working hours.
